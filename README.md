# Sk-Mart-Case-Study
Analyse the retail supermarket chain performance and scrutinize the KPI's

## 💡 Why This Project?
### I genuinely interested about  **retail supermarket chain** Bangladesh where they need to compete with other local grocery shops. Through the project, I get to understand how the retail shops are being operated and how to analyse the overall business performance when customer is middle point of attraction. This is part of my SQL Mastery course with Interactive cares where I got the opportunity of decompose the data into meaningful insights.

My goal was to uncover insights that could help food delivery businesses better understand their top customers.

## 🔍 Analysis Approach
### All insights were derived using **SQL**, leveraging **JOIN, CTE, WINDOWS, Case Statement, Aggregate functions** to analyse and visualise the data. I analyzed a dataset to figure out:

- **Who** are the high-value customers?
- **What and when** do they actually buy?
- **How** marketing efforts can ****turn their customers into buying from the shops?

## Here's what I found:
